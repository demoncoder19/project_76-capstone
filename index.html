            A solar eclipse occurs when a portion of the Earth is engulfed in a shadow cast by the Moon which fully or partially blocks sunlight. This occurs when the Sun, Moon and Earth are aligned. Such alignment coincides with a new moon indicating the Moon is closest to the ecliptic plane. Solar eclipse' usually last for under 7 minutes, so the next time a solar eclipse occurs make sure that you are preparted. The longest time of a full solar eclipse is 7.5 minutes. There are four to seven solar eclipses each year though only the people along the path of the eclipse are able to see it.There are four types of solar eclipses: total, partial, annual and hybrid. Total solar eclipses happen when the sun is completely blocked by the moon.

During a lunar eclipse, Earth gets in the way of the Sun's light hitting the Moon. That means that during the night, a full moon fades away as Earth's shadow covers it up. The Moon can also look reddish because Earth's atmosphere absorbs the other colors while it bends some sunlight toward the Moon.Unlike a solar eclipse, which can only be viewed from a relatively small area of the world, a lunar eclipse may be viewed from anywhere on the night side of Earth. A total lunar eclipse can last up to nearly 2 hours, while a total solar eclipse lasts only up to a few minutes at any given place, because the Moon's shadow is smaller. Also unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are safe to view without any eye protection or special precautions, as they are dimmer than the full Moon.
